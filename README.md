<a name="introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>

An architectural decision (AD) is a software design choice that addresses a significant requirement.

An architectural decision record (ADR) is a way to track an AD, such as by writing notes, or logging information.

An architecturally significant requirement (ASR) is a requirement that has a measurable effect on a software system’s architecture.

All these are within the topic of architectural knowledge management (AKM).

The goal of this document is to provide a fast overview of ADRs, how to create them, and where to look for more information.
